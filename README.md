# School Schedule Generator
**Artificial Intelligence course project**

This project was developed for an Artificial Intelligence course. It uses genetic algorithms, implemented from ZERO, to generate optimal school schedules by analyzing classes, courses, and teachers.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm**: Use of the Genetic Algorithm (AI) to generate efficient schedules.
- **CSV Input**: Reads data from `classes.csv`, `courses.csv`, and `teachers.csv` for scheduling.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Supports varying constraints and preferences for classes and teachers.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Main logic implementation.
